# Eye-Empower_idea
Assistive Smart Glasses for the Visually Impaired
Hello I’m Mariam and this is *my graduation project prototype called EyeEmpower.
It’s a wearable AI powered system that I built with the goal of empowering visually impaired individuals and giving them more independence, accessibility, and confidence in their daily lives.
Unlike many existing solutions, EyeEmpower focuses on offline usability, Arabic language support, affordable price, and advanced navigation (SLAM-based) all in one device.#3 
# Key Features
 Native Arabic Support full accessibility for Arabic speaking users.
 Offline Capability  works even without internet.
 Payment Integration (Developing) planned for future secure transactions.
 SLAM-based Navigation real-time indoor/outdoor guidance.
 Battery Life – 4–5 hours (prototype stage).
 Affordable – estimated at $1,200 (much cheaper than OrCam MyEye at $4,500).

# Vision
I created EyeEmpower as a step toward digital inclusion.
My vision is to combine computer vision, AI and assistive tech into a device that’s not only powerful but also practical, localized and affordable for visually impaired users especially in regions where Arabic support is still missing.
